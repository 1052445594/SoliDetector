==== Dependence on tx.origin ====

SWC ID: 115

Severity: Low

Contract: TAMC

Function name: transferTo_txorigin15(address,uint256,address)

PC address: 950

Estimated Gas Usage: 289 - 384

Use of tx.origin as a part of authorization control.

The tx.origin environment variable has been found to influence a control flow decision. Note that using tx.origin as a security control might cause a situation where a user inadvertently authorizes a smart contract to perform an action on their behalf. It is recommended to use msg.sender instead.
