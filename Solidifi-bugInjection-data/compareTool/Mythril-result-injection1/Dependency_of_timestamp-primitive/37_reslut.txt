==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====

SWC ID: 107

Severity: Low

Contract: AugustCoin

Function name: approveAndCall(address,uint256,bytes)

PC address: 2783

Estimated Gas Usage: 9338 - 68443

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.

An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.
